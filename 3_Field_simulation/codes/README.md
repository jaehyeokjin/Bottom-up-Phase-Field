# Phase-Field Simulation: Bottom-Up Model

This folder contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks that implement the bottom-up phase-field model described in the associated research paper. The primary objective is to simulate phase evolution using a parametrized free energy functional.

## Files Included

- **Field-simulation.ipynb**: A polished, step-by-step Jupyter notebook designed to guide users through performing phase-field simulations. This notebook includes detailed explanations and uses the parametrized free energy form for simulating phase evolution.
  
- **final.py**: The raw Python script used for the phase-field simulation. This script implements the same model as the Jupyter notebook but without the accompanying explanations or interactive features.

## Instructions

1. Open the **Field-simulation.ipynb** notebook to follow the simulation process with explanations at each step.
2. Use the **final.py** script if you prefer running the simulation without the notebook environment or if you want a standalone Python version of the code.
