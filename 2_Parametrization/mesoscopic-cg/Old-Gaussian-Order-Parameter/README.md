README
* Within this folder, there are three subfolders correspond to three different order parameters derived from the atomistic simulation
	** Gaussian density (old cutoff): used in the first version of the draft of the manuscript
		- Use the following cutoff: rho_0 = 800, rho_cut = 1132, phi_zero = 2
	** Gaussian density (updated cutoff): used in the follow-up manuscript using the force-matching
		- Use the following cutoff: rho_0 = 798, rho_cut = 1126, phi_zero = 5
	** Bond Order Parameter: Work in progress (May 2025)
